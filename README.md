### Design Patterns
There are several ways to study design patterns. One simple and strongly adopted approach is to classify and study it through their utility on class
As per the utility they are broadly classified into 3 sets

* **Creational**: Deals with how are objects/class created
* **Structural**: Deals with organising classes/objects to form larger structure and provide new functionality
* **Behavioural**: Deals with  identifying common communication patterns between object
